# Welcome to my blog!

I made it in a single day because production comes first, features come later. I think that scaling it with blog posts and adding features once they're relevant is more important than just making the whole thing as perfect as possible.

- PicoCss (css framework)
- mdx (markdown)
- Vercel (host)
